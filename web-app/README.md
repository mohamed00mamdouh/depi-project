A CRUD web app is a web application that allows users to perform the four basic operations of persistent storage: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are typically performed on data stored in a database or similar data storage system.

Here's a breakdown of CRUD:

1. Create: This allows users to add new records or data entries. For example, in a blog app, this could be creating a new blog post.

2. Read: This operation is about retrieving or viewing data. Users can read existing records from the database, such as viewing a list of blog posts.

3. Update: This allows users to modify existing records. For example, editing the content of a blog post.

4. Delete: This operation lets users remove data from the system, like deleting a blog post.

A typical CRUD web app involves interaction with a backend database, often through an API or directly from the server. It might also include front-end components for user interaction, such as forms to input data, buttons for creating or deleting items, and so on.

CRUD operations are fundamental for most dynamic web applications and are commonly found in content management systems, user management platforms, and various administrative dashboards.
